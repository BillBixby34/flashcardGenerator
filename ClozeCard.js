//2. **Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text 
//(_"... was the first president of the United States."_),
// and the full text when the user requests it (_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_)
//This file should define a Node module that exports a constructor 
//for creating cloze-deletion flashcards, e.g.:`module.exports = ClozeCard;`

//* The constructor should accept two arguments: `text` and `cloze`.
//The constructor will have 3 properties
//`cloze` property that contains _only_ the cloze-deleted portion of the text.

//`partial` property that contains _only_ the partial text.

//`fullText` property that contains _only_ the full text.

//throw or log an error when the cloze deletion does _not_ appear in the input text.

//Use prototypes to attach these methods, wherever possible.
